# NBA-ML-Team-Win-Predictions
This program uses a machine learning model to predict the amount of NBA team wins per season

To run the program, enter the season you want to start with for your training data and the amount of seasons 
before that in which you want to include in the data. This will be used to train the machine learning model.

After that, you enter the starting season in which you want to predict the amount of wins and then the number of 
seasons before that which you want to predict as well.
